Hello!

For this assignment I made a weather application. 
You type in a city and press enter. 

You will get information on:
- current date
- current temp
- current weather condition 
- highest and lowest temp of the day

This was a fun project. First time I use information from an API and it was not as complicated as I tought it would be. 
I made comments to all the files and relevent code blocks. I learned a whole lot.

This site is fully responsive. 

Hope you enjoy!

Here is the API I used for this assignment: https://openweathermap.org/

I followed this tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4dtwWgRueI
